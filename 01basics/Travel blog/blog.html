               <p>Scouting New York
               As a movie location scout in New York City, Nick Carr puts miles 
               in each week in search of the perfect setting and chronicles his 
               finds on his blog. He’s toured countless spots throughout the five 
               boroughs, from luxury apartments to rooftops to subway tunnels.
                As an urban explorer, he’s discovered places that 
                even lifelong New Yorkers don’t know about, and claims 
                that “every street has a hidden gem or two
                 if you take the time to look.” So the next time you stroll 
                 down the block where you live, stare like a scout because you,
                  too, might unearth a New York treasure
                   that’s longing to be found.
